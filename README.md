# Credits and script use

The [PMXCrossover method](https://github.com/Path3m/test-optigen/blob/main/Crossover/celaus_user_modified/pmx_modified.js) used in this genetic optimisation come from [this already implemented method](https://gist.github.com/celaus/d5a55e723ce233f2b83af36a4cf456b4) by [celaus](https://github.com/celaus).
